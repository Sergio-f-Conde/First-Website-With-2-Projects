# First-Website-With-2-Projects
Found in website: Photo Filter Application &amp; Green Screen Photo Compiler

Please follow this link, it will take you to the website where applications are held:
https://codepen.io/sergio-f-conde/pen/bGbggMW

The HTML,CSS, and JavaScript code for the website is easily accessible on codepen.io, which is why I decided not to upload it 
to github too. On the JavaScript code I put comments seperating code for the Green Screen application and Photo Filter programs,
making it easier to spot and in case anyone wants to use the code for their own applications.

This is my first website project and had fun styling it to my personality, enjoy the content, have fun!
